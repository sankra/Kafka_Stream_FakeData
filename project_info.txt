Kafka Data Stream Project – Overview
📌 Project Description
This project implements a real-time data streaming pipeline using Apache Kafka as the central message broker. It ingests, processes, and distributes high-volume, low-latency data across distributed systems for analytics, monitoring, and business intelligence.


🚀 Key Features
🔄 Real-time data ingestion from multiple sources (e.g., REST APIs, DBs, logs).
⚡ High-throughput, low-latency streaming using Kafka Topics and Partitions.
🔧 Stream processing with Apache Spark / Kafka Streams / Flink.
🗃️ Data persistence to data lakes (e.g., S3, HDFS) or warehouses (e.g., Redshift, Snowflake).
📊 Real-time analytics dashboards via Elasticsearch/Kibana or Grafana.
